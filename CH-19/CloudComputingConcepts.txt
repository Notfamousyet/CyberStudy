Cloud computing means using IT services like storage, software, and servers over the internet, instead of owning them. These services are managed by companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft at remote locations. Users can access these services on demand and pay only for what they use. Common examples include Gmail, Facebook, Dropbox, and Salesforce.com. This topic covers the basics of cloud computing, types of services, roles and responsibilities, deployment models, NIST reference architecture, cloud storage structure, and major service providers.

Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1) On-demand self-service
2) Distributed storage
3) Rapid elasticity
4) Automated management
5) Broad network access
6) cloud provider shares physical and virtual resources among many users, automatically giving them as needed.
7) Virtualization lets cloud systems quickly add or remove resources like storage or computing power, which isn't easy in normal setups.

Limitations of Cloud Computing 
1) Companies have limited control over cloud systems and settings.
2) Cloud services can go down or face technical problems.
3) Storing data online can raise privacy and security concerns.
4) Itâ€™s hard to switch providers once you sign a contract.
5) You must have a stable internet connection to use cloud services.
6) Being online makes systems more exposed to hackers.
7) Moving data and apps to another cloud provider can be complicated.

Types of Cloud Computing Services

1)Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service where companies can rent basic IT resources like servers/processing power, Storage (like hard drives) Networking , Virtual machines (software-based computers). Instead of buying and maintaining physical hardware, companies use these resources from cloud providers on demand, like renting space or power only when needed.
Advantages of IaaS :
1]You can quickly increase or reduce resources as your needs change.
2]These services often promise to be available nearly all the time.
3]Tasks like backups, monitoring, and updates can be automated.
4]Distributes traffic across servers to keep things running smoothly.
5]You can set rules (policies) for how the resources should behave (e.g., who can access what).
6]You can access your services from anywhere in the world using the internet.
Disadvantages of IaaS :
1]Since the services are run by third parties and accessed over the internet, they are more open to hacking and security threats.
2]Sometimes the connection might be slow, or resources may not work as fast as expected.

2)Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a cloud service that gives you a ready-made platform to build and run your own applications.
you donâ€™t need to worry about buying or managing the servers, storage, operating systems, or software needed to build your app â€” the cloud provider takes care of all that.
You just focus on writing and deploying your code, while the platform handles the rest (like setup, scaling, and backups).
Examples of PaaS Providers: Google App Engine, Salesforce, Microsoft Azure (App Services)
Advantages of PaaS
1]No need to set up infrastructure â€” just upload your code.
2]Includes built-in tools and services like databases, messaging, and analytics.
3]More secure than IaaS, since less control means fewer chances of mistakes.
4]Many developers use it, so help is easy to find.
5]You pay only for the resources you use.
6]The system grows with your app automatically.
Disadvantages of PaaS
1]Once you use one providerâ€™s tools, itâ€™s hard to switch to another.
2]Since your app and data are on a third-party server, privacy can be a concern.
3]Sometimes it's hard to connect your cloud app with other systems you already use.

3)Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a type of cloud service where you use software or applications over the internet, instead of installing them on your computer.The software is hosted and managed by the cloud provider, and you simply open it in a web browser whenever you need it.You usually pay based on how much you use, through a subscription, advertising, or sharing it with others.
Examples of SaaS: Google Docs or Google Calendar, Salesforce CRM, FreshBooks
Advantages of SaaS
1]No need to buy expensive software or hardware â€” just pay for what you use.
2]You donâ€™t have to install, update, or fix anything â€” the provider handles it all.
3]You can access the software from any device with internet.
4]No need for special systems â€” just a browser and internet.
Disadvantages of SaaS
1]Data is stored online, which can be risky, and performance may depend on your internet speed.
2]You need a stable internet connection to use the service.
3]If you want to move your data from one SaaS provider to another, it can be difficult.

4)Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) is a cloud-based service that helps companies manage user identities and control who can access what systems or data.It is managed by a third-party provider, so businesses donâ€™t need to build their own systems for login and security. This service helps make sure only the right people can access the right data, whether they are working from the office or remotely.
What Does IDaaS Offer :
1]One login to access many apps or systems.
2]Extra layer of security (like a code sent to your phone).
3]Managing and monitoring user roles, access, and permissions.
4]Controls who can access what.
5]Keeps records and detects unusual or risky behavior.
Examples of IDaaS Providers: OneLogin,Centrify Identity Service,Microsoft Azure Active Directory,Okta
Advantages of IDaaS
1]No need to build or manage your own identity system.
2]Strong authentication methods keep your data safe.
3]Easier to meet security and privacy laws.
4]Users log in once to access multiple tools.
5]Easily manage all user accounts from one place.
Disadvantages of IDaaS
1]users may not be able to log in or services may slow down.
2]If a hacker steals a login, they could access many systems.

5)Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) is a cloud-based service where security tools and services are provided over the internet.
Instead of buying expensive equipment or hiring a full security team, businesses can rent security services from expert companies. These services protect their systems, data, and networks without needing any physical hardware.It is based on SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), so everything runs online and is managed by a third party.
What Does SECaaS Offer:
Checks if your system can be hacked.
Makes sure only the right people can log in.
Watches for suspicious activity or hacking attempts.
Protects against viruses and harmful software.
Tracks and manages security threats.
Examples of SECaaS Providers: eSentire MDR, Switchfast Technologies, OneNeck IT Solutions, Foundstone Managed Security Services
Advantages of SECaaS:
1]No need to buy and manage your own security equipment.
2]Reduces complexity of setting up security systems.
3]Your systems are protected 24/7.
4]You get help from professionals who know the latest threats.
5]Always using the newest and most effective security tools.
6]Users and devices can be protected fast.
7]You can scale up or down based on your needs.
8]Companies can focus on their main goals while security is handled by experts.
Disadvantages of SECaaS:
1]Since everything is online, there's a larger area for hackers to attack.
2]You may not fully know how secure the third-party provider is.
3]If the connection between your systems and the service is weak, it can be attacked.
4]Services may not fit perfectly with your companyâ€™s specific needs.
5]If someone steals login details, they could misuse your security tools.

6)Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) is a cloud service that lets developers build, manage, and run container-based applications easily over the internet or in their own data centers.Containers are like small packages that hold your app and everything it needs to run (like code, system tools, libraries), so your app can run the same way anywhere.CaaS helps manage these containers, group them into clusters, and run them reliably and efficiently using cloud platforms or special tools.Itâ€™s a mix of both IaaS (infrastructure) and PaaS (platform) features.
What Does CaaS Provide :
Tools to run and manage containers.
Organize and control how containers run.
Easy ways to control your containers from a browser or program.
Examples of CaaS Providers: Amazon EC2, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Advantages of CaaS:
01]Developers can build apps quickly using containers.
02]No need to buy full servers.
03]Apps are more reliable and work the same on any system.
04]Containers can move easily between systems without breaking.
05]No need for big setups or hardware.
06]Uses fewer system resources.
07]If one app crashes, others are not affected.
08]Containers keep apps separate and secure.
09]Patches and changes can be applied faster.
10]Easily grow or shrink your app to handle more or fewer users.
Disadvantages of CaaS:
1]You need to manage container tools, monitoring, and scaling yourself.
2]Developers must set up and handle the platform to run containers, which can be tricky.

7)Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a cloud service that lets you run small pieces of code (functions) without needing to manage any servers or infrastructure.This is known as **serverless computing**, which means the cloud provider takes care of everything behind the scenes (like servers, scaling, and maintenance). You just write your code, and it runs **only when needed**.

Itâ€™s mostly used for **microservices**, where an app is broken into small, independent parts that do specific tasks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **When Does FaaS Run?**

Your code (called a **function**) runs **only when an event triggers it**â€”like a user clicking a button, a file being uploaded, or a device sending data.

**No event = no function running = no cost.**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **What Can FaaS Be Used For?**

* **IoT (Internet of Things):** Handling data from smart devices.
* **Mobile and web apps:** Running parts of the app in the background.
* **Batch and stream processing:** Handling large amounts of data in chunks or real-time.
Examples of FaaS Providers: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, Oracle Functions
Advantages of FaaS:
1]You are charged only when your function runs.
2]No need to pay for servers or unused resources.
3]The provider takes care of updates and patches.
4]Just upload your function â€” no complex setup required.
5]It can handle thousands of users without any extra setup.
Disadvantages of FaaS:
1]There might be a delay (called "cold start") when a function runs for the first time or after being idle.
