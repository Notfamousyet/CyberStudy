Cloud computing means using IT services like storage, software, and servers over the internet, instead of owning them. These services are managed by companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft at remote locations. Users can access these services on demand and pay only for what they use. Common examples include Gmail, Facebook, Dropbox, and Salesforce.com. This topic covers the basics of cloud computing, types of services, roles and responsibilities, deployment models, NIST reference architecture, cloud storage structure, and major service providers.

Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1) On-demand self-service
2) Distributed storage
3) Rapid elasticity
4) Automated management
5) Broad network access
6) cloud provider shares physical and virtual resources among many users, automatically giving them as needed.
7) Virtualization lets cloud systems quickly add or remove resources like storage or computing power, which isn't easy in normal setups.

Limitations of Cloud Computing 
1) Companies have limited control over cloud systems and settings.
2) Cloud services can go down or face technical problems.
3) Storing data online can raise privacy and security concerns.
4) It’s hard to switch providers once you sign a contract.
5) You must have a stable internet connection to use cloud services.
6) Being online makes systems more exposed to hackers.
7) Moving data and apps to another cloud provider can be complicated.

Types of Cloud Computing Services

1)Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service where companies can rent basic IT resources like servers/processing power, Storage (like hard drives) Networking , Virtual machines (software-based computers). Instead of buying and maintaining physical hardware, companies use these resources from cloud providers on demand, like renting space or power only when needed.
Advantages of IaaS :
1]You can quickly increase or reduce resources as your needs change.
2]These services often promise to be available nearly all the time.
3]Tasks like backups, monitoring, and updates can be automated.
4]Distributes traffic across servers to keep things running smoothly.
5]You can set rules (policies) for how the resources should behave (e.g., who can access what).
6]You can access your services from anywhere in the world using the internet.
Disadvantages of IaaS :
1]Since the services are run by third parties and accessed over the internet, they are more open to hacking and security threats.
2]Sometimes the connection might be slow, or resources may not work as fast as expected.

2)Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a cloud service that gives you a ready-made platform to build and run your own applications.
you don’t need to worry about buying or managing the servers, storage, operating systems, or software needed to build your app — the cloud provider takes care of all that.
You just focus on writing and deploying your code, while the platform handles the rest (like setup, scaling, and backups).
Examples of PaaS Providers: Google App Engine, Salesforce, Microsoft Azure (App Services)
Advantages of PaaS
1]No need to set up infrastructure — just upload your code.
2]Includes built-in tools and services like databases, messaging, and analytics.
3]More secure than IaaS, since less control means fewer chances of mistakes.
4]Many developers use it, so help is easy to find.
5]You pay only for the resources you use.
6]The system grows with your app automatically.
Disadvantages of PaaS
1]Once you use one provider’s tools, it’s hard to switch to another.
2]Since your app and data are on a third-party server, privacy can be a concern.
3]Sometimes it's hard to connect your cloud app with other systems you already use.

3)Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a type of cloud service where you use software or applications over the internet, instead of installing them on your computer.The software is hosted and managed by the cloud provider, and you simply open it in a web browser whenever you need it.You usually pay based on how much you use, through a subscription, advertising, or sharing it with others.
Examples of SaaS: Google Docs or Google Calendar, Salesforce CRM, FreshBooks
Advantages of SaaS
1]No need to buy expensive software or hardware — just pay for what you use.
2]You don’t have to install, update, or fix anything — the provider handles it all.
3]You can access the software from any device with internet.
4]No need for special systems — just a browser and internet.
Disadvantages of SaaS
1]Data is stored online, which can be risky, and performance may depend on your internet speed.
2]You need a stable internet connection to use the service.
3]If you want to move your data from one SaaS provider to another, it can be difficult.

4)Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) is a cloud-based service that helps companies manage user identities and control who can access what systems or data.It is managed by a third-party provider, so businesses don’t need to build their own systems for login and security. This service helps make sure only the right people can access the right data, whether they are working from the office or remotely.
What Does IDaaS Offer :
1]One login to access many apps or systems.
2]Extra layer of security (like a code sent to your phone).
3]Managing and monitoring user roles, access, and permissions.
4]Controls who can access what.
5]Keeps records and detects unusual or risky behavior.
Examples of IDaaS Providers: OneLogin,Centrify Identity Service,Microsoft Azure Active Directory,Okta
Advantages of IDaaS
1]No need to build or manage your own identity system.
2]Strong authentication methods keep your data safe.
3]Easier to meet security and privacy laws.
4]Users log in once to access multiple tools.
5]Easily manage all user accounts from one place.
Disadvantages of IDaaS
1]users may not be able to log in or services may slow down.
2]If a hacker steals a login, they could access many systems.
